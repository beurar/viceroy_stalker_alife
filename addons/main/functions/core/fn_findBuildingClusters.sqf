/*
    Finds clusters of buildings that are at least 1km away from any town (of any type) or named location.

    Params:
        0: SCALAR - Min number of buildings to count as a cluster (default: 3)
        1: SCALAR - Radius for detecting nearby buildings (default: 500m)
        2: SCALAR - Distance to avoid from towns (default: 1000m)
        3: SCALAR - Grid step for scanning (default: 500m)

    Returns:
        ARRAY of ARRAYs - Each subarray is a cluster of building POSITIONS
